## 3. Unramified morphisms {#I.3}

::: {.itenv #I.3.1 title="Proposition 3.1"}
Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a morphism of finite type, $x\in X$, and $y=f(x)$.
Then the following conditions are equivalent:

i. $\cal{O}_x/\frak{m}_y\cal{O}_x$ is a finite separable extension of $k(y)$.
ii. $\Omega_{X/Y}^1$ is zero at $x$.
iii. The diagonal morphism $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is an open immersion on a neighbourhood of $x$.
:::

::: {.proof}
For the implication (i) $\implies$ (ii), we can use Nakayama to reduce to the case where $Y=\Spec(k)$ and $X=\Spec(k')$, where it is well known, and also trivial by the definition of separable;
(ii) $\implies$ (iii) comes from a nice and easy characterisation of open immersions, using Krull;
(iii) $\implies$ (i) follows as well from reducing to the case where $Y=\Spec(k)$ and the diagonal morphism is everywhere an open immersion.
We must then prove that $X$ is finite with separable ring over $k$, and this leads us to consider the case where $k$ is algebraically closed.
But then every closed point of $X$ is isolated (since it is identical to the inverse image of the diagonal by the morphism $X\to X\times_k X$ defined by $x$), whence $X$ is finite.
We can thus suppose that $X$ consists of a single point, with ring $A$, and so $A\otimes_k A\to A$ is an isomorphism, hence $A=k$.

a. Let $f$ satisfy one of the equivalent conditions of [3.1](#I.3.1).
  We then say that $f$ is _unramified_ at $x$, or that $X$ is unramified at $x$ on $Y$.
b. Let $A\to B$ be a local homomorphism.
  We say that it is _unramified_, or that $B$ is a local _unramified_ algebra on $A$, if $B/\frak{r}(A)B$ is a finite separable extension of $A/\frak{r}(A)$, i.e. if $\frak{r}(A)B=\frak{r}(B)$ and $k(B)$ is a separable extension of $k(A)$.^[cf. regrets in [III 1.2](#III.1.2).]
:::

::: {.rmenv title="Remarks"}
The fact that $B$ is unramified over $A$ can be seen at the level of the completions of $A$ and $B$.
Unramified implies quasi-finite.
:::

::: {.itenv #I.3.3 title="Corollary 3.3"}
The set of points where $f$ is unramified is open.
:::

::: {.itenv #I.3.4 title="Corollary 3.4"}
Let $X'$ and $X$ be preschemes of finite type over $Y$, and $g\colon X'\to X$ a $Y$-morphism.
If $X$ is unramified over $Y$, then the graph morphism $\Gamma_g\colon X'\to X\times_Y X$ is an open immersion.
:::

Indeed, this is the inverse image of the diagonal morphism $X\to X\times_Y X$ by
$$
  g\times_Y \id_{X'}\colon X'\times_Y X\to X\times_Y X.
$$
One can also introduce the annihilator ideal $\frak{d}_{X/Y}$ of $\Omega_{X/Y}^1$, called the _different ideal_ of $X/Y$;
it defines a closed sub-prescheme of $X$ which, set-theoretically, is the set of point where $X/Y$ is ramified, i.e. not unramified.

i. An immersion is ramified.
ii. The composition of two ramified morphisms is also ramified.
iii. Base extension of a ramified morphisms is also ramified.
:::

We are rather indifferent about (ii) and (iii) (the second seems more interesting to me).
We can, of course, also be more precise, by giving some one-off statements;
this is more general only in appearance (except for in the case of definition (b)), and is boring.
We obtain, as per usual, the corollaries:

::: {.itenv #I.3.6 title="Corollary 3.6"}

iv. The cartesian product of two unramified morphisms is unramified.
v. If $gf$ is unramified then so too is $f$.
vi. If $f$ is unramified then so too is $f_\text{red}$.
:::

::: {.itenv #I.3.7 title="Proposition 3.7"}
Let $A\to B$ be a local homomorphism, and suppose that the residue extension $k(B)/k(A)$ is trivial, with $k(A)$ algebraically closed.
In order for $B/A$ to be unramified, it is necessary and sufficient that $\hat{B}$ be (as an $\hat{A}$-algebra) a quotient of $\hat{A}$.
:::

::: {.rmenv title="Remarks"}

- In the case where we don't suppose that the residue extension is trivial, we can reduce to the case where it is by taking a suitable finite flat extension of $A$ which destroys the aforementioned extension.
- Consider the example where $A$ is the local ring of an ordinary double point of a curve, and $B$ a point of its normalisation:
  then $A\subset B$, $B$ is unramified over $A$ with trivial residue extension, and $\hat{A}\to\hat{B}$ is surjective but _not injective_.
  We are thus going to strengthen the notion of unramified-ness.
